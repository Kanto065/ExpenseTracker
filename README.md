# ExpenseTracker
I used code first approach, asp.net core 6, entity framework core, for database I used ms sql.  i tried making different project under one solution, i made interface for my method. And created a separate project for model class and data transfer object. Lastly for a dependency infection problem I faced. I shifted to .net core mvc model. There I made context class models again, added connection sting to program.cs file. Created controller for all the task I have to do, I created async method which are good practice. For time limitation I donâ€™t be able to make different project for business logic layer and data access layer. Bootstrap class is used for view, All the requirements are fulfilled.
